- Do you plan to charge for the logseq app (desktop/web/mobile)?
  > All the existing local-only features (including the latest SRS cards, pdf annoations, zotero integration) will be free to use, we'll announce a monthly subscription for syncing with our own storage, real-time collaboration, and other pro features in the future.
- Do you commit to open source the frontend code (including the desktop/web/mobile apps) forever?
  > Yes. You can build the apps with the latest code and it'll work with your local files (markdown/org). The mobile app might start with a simple API for quick capture but eventually, it'll have local files support.
- Are you going to open-source the future server-side backend?
  > We have no plans for that. But we're considering providing a free self-host sync option for non-profit organizations or researchers in the future, the sync service for our own storage is not started yet.
