tags:: myPageTag
section:: Usage

- Queries are used to _ask questions_ to your knowledge content. You can query for [[pages]], [[blocks]], [[tags]], [[tasks]] and more.
- There are two types of queries: [[Queries/Simple Queries]] and [[Queries/Advanced Queries]] .

  #+BEGIN_TIP
  **Debugging queries**
  Whenever your queries do not seem to return the right result, you can debug them and check for syntax errors - open the _Developer Tools_ in your browser, go to the _Console_ tab and look for `$APP.Tl` (click on it)

  #+BEGIN_TIP
  **Querying page names or properties**
  When querying for page names or properties always write them in _lowercase_ - this is how they are stored in Logseq's database
  #+END_TIP
-
  #+BEGIN_TIP
  **Queries as tables & sorting**
  * You can render query results as tables (click on the toggle) and select which fields/columns to include.
  * You can sort table by clicking on a column name.
  #+END_TIP

  #+BEGIN_NOTE
  **Technical details**
  Queries are written in the [[Datalog]] progamming language ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Datalog)).  There are various flavours/systems of Datalog. A common one is _DataScript_, written in Clojure, the programming language Logseq is written in (or rather ClojureScript). DataScript is an in-memory database running on either ClojureScript or Java (JVM). Another common one is _Datomic_, which is a commercial database.

## Queries in [[Journal]] Pages
	- You can add default queries to each new journal entry (displayed at the bottom) by editing the [[config.edn]] file in your [[Graph]] directory and adding them to this section:
	  id:: 610afd9a-36b6-475b-bdaa-e03c64ca3c0c
	  ```clojure
	  :default-queries
	  {:journals
	    [
	  ;; Your queries here:
	  ;; {query1}
	  ;; {query2}
	    ]
	  }
	  ```
		-
		  #+BEGIN_WARNING
		  Many default queries may slow down Logseq (see [here](((6109951e-1c4d-4491-8147-9c4072672d56)))).
		  #+END_WARNING
## Query Table Functions
id:: 610fdfba-d6cf-4bb1-a88d-b3fe28e0a72d
	- You can use _functions_ to process a query table's output.
	- Functions allow you to perform aggregations such as calculating the sum or average value (`sum`, `average`, minimum (`min`), maximum (`max`), `total`) or by performing an arbitrary function written in Clojure.
		- Aggregations always have the format of `{{function (<aggregation type> :<property keyword>)}}`
	- **USAGE**
		-
		  1. Create a query in table view
		  1. Define a function in this query's child block
	- **EXAMPLES**
		- Let's create a few block properties.
		  type:: query-table-block
		  name:: my-first-block
		  index:: 1
		  number-of-sentences:: 1
		- And here is another block.
			- This block is also going to have block properties.
			  type:: query-table-block
			  name:: my-second-block
			  index:: 2
			  number-of-sentences:: 2
		- And lastly, a third block.
			- Similar to the other two blocks, we are going to add some properties.
			- This block is also going to have a new property.
			- This is going to be the last block.
			  type:: query-table-block
			  name:: my-third-block
			  index:: 3
			  number-of-sentences:: 4
			  is-last-block:: true
		- {{query (property type query-table-block)}}
		  query-table:: true
		  query-properties:: [:name :index :number-of-sentences :is-last-block]
			- Now, let's calculate
				- the average number of sentences: {{function (average :number-of-sentences)}} (`{{function (average :number-of-sentences)}}`)
				- the highest number of sentences: {{function (max :number-of-sentences)}} (`{{function (max :number-of-sentences)}}`)
				- the number of all sentences: {{function (sum :number-of-sentences)}} (`{{function (total :number-of-sentences)}}`)
				- something arbitrary like multiplying the index of each block with its number of sentences (like a weighting), and taking the sum of all: {{function (sum (map (fn [x] (* (:index x) (:number-of-sentences x))) result))}} `{{function (sum (map (fn [x] (* (:index x) (:number-of-sentences x))) result))}}`
			-
			  #+BEGIN_WARNING
			  The function has to be a child of the query table.
			  #+END_WARNING

- (not sure if true)`:block/name` is the block's name; note that there is [no `:page/name`](https://github.com/logseq/logseq/blob/master/src/main/frontend/db_schema.cljs) - a page is simply a special block -> no, there is
