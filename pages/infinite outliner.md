alias:: Infinite Outliners

- Infinite outliners are a category of textual knowledge management tools that organize content into individual _blocks_, whereby each block can be collapsed/expanded or opened in its own view.
- Outliners typically allow you to link content via references to individual blocks of content. They also do not work in a typical page-by-page mode like a word processing software like Microsoft Word. Instead, you generate content by linking to other [[blocks]] of content - the result of connections between blocks of content is called a _[[Graph]]_.

  #+BEGIN_TIP
  Even a page is simply a block with sub-blocks (child blocks).
  #+END_TIP
- The concept of blocks and links allows you to quickly see _where_ you referenced a certain topic, _how_ the topic relates to other topics, and avoids duplicating information.
- There are many infinite outliner apps available: (taken from [carlpaul153](https://www.reddit.com/r/productivity/comments/j5jru1/comparison_guide_of_infinite_outliner_apps/))

	  > [Workflowy](https://workflowy.com/): it was the first infinite outliner. It is definitely the simplest and most minimalist of all. For many this is a good thing and for others it is not. Either way, the developers seem to be on the side of the first one, since for years the improvements have been almost nil. If you are looking for something simple, minimalist, without distractions and you don't need a lot of features, Workflowy is probably your option.

	  > [Dynalist](https://dynalist.io/why): It came as a response from Workflowy users who wanted more features. Being that they achieved one of the best products on the market and that it was the second alternative, it is the best known along with Workflowy. The interface is still simple, minimalist and pleasant, but with more features.

	  > [Moo.do](https://dynalist.io/why): Similar to the previous ones but with an approach oriented to managing tasks and emails as well.
	-
	  > [Roam Research](https://dynalist.io/why): The product looks really good and I've only heard positive things. Unfortunately, it is very expensive and only has a paid version, so I have not been able to test it. Although many of these apps allow you to link notes with double brackets, Roam Research shows a very strong focus on the relationships or connections between the notes.
	-
	  > [Transno](https://dynalist.io/why): It has the simplicity of Workflowy but with many options. One of them is that it allows you to change the notes view to a mind map. In addition, it allows you to insert images into the text and resize them, something that Dynalist and Workflowy surprisingly do not do.

	  > [Remnote](https://www.remnote.io/): It is oriented to learning through spaced repetition and that is something I love. However, it is still in the development stage. I would like some outliner to have some kind of synchronization with anki, which I can't imagine abandoning, at least in the short term.

	  > [LearnObit](https://www.remnote.io/): Also geared towards spaced repetition and in development stage. But right now it looks even greener and uglier.
