  > Spaced repetition (SRS) is an evidence-based learning technique that is usually performed with flashcards. It is based on learning over a longer period time with distributed sessions. Newly introduced and more difficult flashcards are shown more frequently, while older and less difficult flashcards are shown less frequently in order to exploit the psychological _spacing effect_.[^1] The use of spaced repetition has been proven to increase rate of learning. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaced_repetition)
  [^1]: The spacing effect demonstrates that learning is more effective when study sessions are spaced out. This effect shows that more information is encoded into long-term memory by spaced study sessions
- TODO Add details, examples for cards, clozes
- You can use Spaced Repetition with [[Logseq]] via _cards_
	- _Cards_ are question-answer cards.
		- _^^Example:^^_
	- _Clozes_ (cloze item, cloze question, cloze deletion) can be used to generate fill-in-the-blank-forms (LÃ¼ckentexte) for easier learning. They can be used within cards. (^^or in general?^^)
		- _Example:_
		  > The limit for SOQL queries is (...).
		  > [The answer is 200]
