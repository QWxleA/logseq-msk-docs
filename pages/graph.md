alias:: Graphs, workspace

- _Graphs_ are the representation of all [[blocks]] (bullets) and [[pages]] (which are simply blocks) - i.e. all items of knowledge - and their relationship with each other.
- Items (nodes) of a graph can be [[blocks]], [[pages]] and [[tags]] - again, in effect, all of them are the same. The connection between your items of knowledge allows you generate new insights.

- You can think of a graph as your _workspace_ - you can work with different graphs and switch between them, for example to split work and private knowledge (simply click on the graph name on the top right toolbar). In Logseq, each graph is stored as its own folder that includes settings for Logseq and your content.
