- Tags can be used to group pages or blocks by typing `#<tag>`. Tags are in essence just another visualisation for pages - they work in the same way.
- **USAGE & EXAMPLES**

	  #+BEGIN_TIP
	          Technically tags and pages are the same, both create a new page. However, I use tags with a different _semantic_ meaning compared to pages. From a Logseq view, tags can be _styled_ differently via [[Custom CSS]] and page-level tags can be queried for. With [[Custom CSS]] you can highlight certain tags differently.
	          #+END_TIP
	- Tags can be added to blocks #myTag or pages by adding a page-level [[property]] as `tags:: myTag, myOtherTag`
		- _Note:_ You could also put [[myTag]] on the page as tags and pages are the same
	- You can click on a tag to find all references - or open its page to check references (remember, a tag is the same as a page!).
	- To use tags with spaces, either use them `[[as a page]]` or `use-dashes` (note that the dash will be part of the page name). #my-other-tag
	- Blocks may have multiple tags #myTagA #myTagB
	- There is no limit to the number of tags  #myTagA #myTagB #myTagC

  #+BEGIN_TIP
  Make a conscious decision on _how_ to phrase tags. Let's assume you want to tag items to read up on. You could use `to-read`, `read` or other variations. You have to be consistent when tagging. Remember that you can use [[Aliases]].
