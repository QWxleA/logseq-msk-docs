- _Document mode_ is a dedicated way of using Logseq for writing longer documents as you would with a typical word processor.
- Longer documents typically consist of fewer blocks and instead use line breaks more often
- Logseq's document mode can be toggled by pressing `t d`. It is indicated by `D` in the window toolbar (you may also click on it to disable it and switch back to dot mode).
- While in document mode
	- [[Bullet]] indicators are hidden
	- The `Enter` key is swapped to add a line break instead of block and `Shift+Enter` to add a new block instead of line break
