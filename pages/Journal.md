- You can use your journal to document _daily_ or _dated_ information.
- Examples for _trigger questions_ to ask yourself daily are:
	- What have I learned?
	- What am I grateful for?
	- What could I do differently?
	- What ideas did I have?
	- What do I need to do today?
	- What is my progress on six month goals?
	- What is my progress on my year goals?
- **USAGE**
	- Create new journal pages by
	  1. Going to the Journal (`cmd+j` or three dots menu > All journals) and adding text to a blank journal entry
	  1. Creating a new page that follows your date format (set at _[[Settings]] > Preferred date format_) and adding text to it

	  #+BEGIN_TIP
	  The easiest way to create an entry for a specific date is to use the `/Date Picker` [[command]], or for relative dates: `/Today`, `/Yesterday`, `/Tomorrow`.
	  There is also a third-party [[plugin]] [logseq-journals-calendar](https://github.com/logseq/logseq-plugin-samples/tree/master/logseq-journals-calendar).
